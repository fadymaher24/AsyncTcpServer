# AsyncTcpServer
A C# project for building a high-performance asynchronous TCP server with graceful shutdown and error handling.

# Repository Description
This repository contains a C# project for building an asynchronous TCP server. The server listens for incoming client connections, handles them asynchronously, and receives data from clients. It includes error handling, graceful shutdown, and configuration options for the server's IP address and port number.
